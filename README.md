 User List App (Using External API)
This is a Laravel-based web page that displays a list of users fetched from a public API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users). It allows you to search users by name â€” all done directly in the browser using JavaScript.

ðŸ”§ What This Project Does
Uses an external API to get user data

Shows a table of user names, emails, and addresses

Lets you search users by name

No need for Laravel controller or database â€” everything happens in the browser

Files Used
resources/views/users/index.blade.php
This is the only file you need. It contains HTML + CSS + JavaScript to:

Call the API
